This project is a basic practice about how to construct SCARA robot in Matlab and URDF separately, and the 7-DOF with gaussion robot in URDF.

Firstly, about the matlab, we can directly download and run it in Matlab environment.

Secondly, about the URDF, we need to configure the environment of kinematic in Ubuntu 16.4, and then download the foder robot and gaussion at the root directory of terminal separately, finally according to a serial of commands to run it.
